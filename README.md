<br>

### Description 

Formik is a small library that can help with the these aspects of creating forms in React:

- Getting values in and out of the form state
- Validation and error messages
- Handling form submission

- By collecting all of the above in one place, Formik can keep things organized, making testing, refactoring, and reasoning forms much easier.

The form should implement the following input validation rules:

- If the username or password inputs are empty, the message "field required" should be displayed under the text input.
- If the username is not in an email format, the message "username should be an email" should be displayed under the text input.
- If the username and password pass the validation above, the message "Login Successful" should be displayed in an `alert` box.

### To Run this program

- Add `node_modules` to the file save exclusion.
- From the startup script, download and extract `node_modules` from cloud storage then `npm start`

### Future RoadMap 

- This project shows how to build a basic Formik Form and there is room for more improvements.
